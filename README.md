# UnderstandingOpenCV
Contains all my openCV python programs made during learning and implementing it.

Any image that has been uploaded or written in files can be replaced by any image of user's choice. Same for gogle colab, wherein I have used files.upload() which asks for a file in system to upload for usage. So an image of user's choice will do.

The jupyter notebooks have been created using Google Colab platform.
